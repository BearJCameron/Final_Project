            <p id="body_text">
                I grew up in a less than favorable environment as my biological mother was a less than favorable
                type of person. Ultimately she chose addiction over her children and there was a lot of fallout
                emotionally and physically on my siblings and myself. After almost ten years, at age 13, I was able
                to finally get my siblings out of her care and with my grandparents. It was difficult for me to be
                the child they expected me to be as I had spent my childhood in a much more adult capacity so I 
                ultimately ended up emancipating and living on my own. I worked on ranches mostly, mending fence and
                building corrals and working with horses. I worked contruction up until I was 21 and then went to the
                Hall Ambulance EMT Academy to start my Emergency Medical Services career. I really enjoyed the medical
                aspect of it and I realized that I had a passion for helping people. I worked EMS for several years but
                the toll it takes on a person physically and mentally finally got to me. My psychological state was not 
                the greatest for a while and I ended up back in construction as it was something easy for me and paid 
                the bills. I got my POST with the Bakersfield Police Department in 2011 but found that work field to be
                both similar to the stress of EMS as well as often contradictory to what I held to be moral and ethical 
                standards for myself. I finally started working with Nelson Industrial Services and had a few years to
                travel the country some more and work in all kinds of unique places like aircraft carriers and
                battleships doing hydro cutting and resurface on nonskid decks. I was never home though and I have quite
                a few children and a loving wife that I really wanted to spend more time with. There were a series of
                unfortunate events in my life during and directly after that time, including several deaths in my family,
                that I let further deteriorate my psychological health. I made some very poor choices of my own and ended
                up paying the price those choices will inevitably bill you for. I've made A LOT of changes and spent uncounted
                hours/days/weeks/months/years working on myself introspectively so that I can not only be the father my 
                children need and the husband my wife deserves, but also the best version of MYSELF that I can be. It has
                been a struggle to find my place in the professional world and I've run in to a lot of barriers that are
                difficult to overcome.....but then I found BitWise!            </p>
